typescript is basically used for type safety
typescript is superset of javascript
but it is not adding any more functionality to js it is just providing
you to write js in more precise manner so you have less error in run time if there
is any error you are shown the error while writing the code only
infact all the code you write is compiled to js 
writing js with more accurate manner it is not compulsory for every task if you have less code
then it is not necessary to use typescript there
typescript helps : much more powerful and error prone
typescript stops all this behaviour
2+"2" ->'22' 
null+2->2
undefined+2->NaN

what typescript is not
static checking is the only job that typescript does
for eg i am trying to access an item which is not defined so if some one can give me a hint 
that object does not exist obv it is much more easier
it just analyze the code
there might be case that your typescript might give you squiggle lines but that code might 
work properly on js
typescript is development tool
it is a superset of js which it helps us to write better code with less problems with a 
more scalable and maintainable code which helps to handle errors
